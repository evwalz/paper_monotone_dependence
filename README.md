# Weather Prediction Model Analysis

This repository contains a simulation example and two case studies from the paper XYZ:

## Case Studies

1. **case_study_wb2**: A comprehensive evaluation of weather prediction models (GraphCast, HRES, and Ensemble forecast) using various metrics including RMSE, accuracy scores, SEEPS, CMA, and CPA.

2. **case_study_LLM**: [To be developed] A case study focusing on the application of Large Language Models in weather prediction analysis.

3. **simulation**: Simulated data for hypothesis testing

## Getting Started

Each case study is self-contained and has its own README file with detailed instructions. Navigate to the respective directory for specific setup and usage instructions.

## Requirements

Each case study has its own specific requirements. Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed information about dependencies and setup.
