# Weather Prediction Model Analysis

This repository contains a simulation example and two case studies from the paper XYZ:

## Case Studies

1. **case_study_wb2**: A comprehensive evaluation of WeatherBench 2 forecasting models (GraphCast, HRES, and Ensemble forecast) using various metrics including RMSE, accuracy scores, SEEPS, CMA, and CPA. For data and original code see **[WeatherBench 2](https://github.com/google-research/weatherbench2)** 

2. **case_study_LLM**: [To be developed] A case study focusing on the application of Large Language Models in weather prediction analysis. For data and original code see **[Rank-Calibration](https://github.com/shuoli90/Rank-Calibration)** 

3. **simulation**: Simulated data for hypothesis testing

## Getting Started

Each case study is self-contained and has its own README file with detailed instructions. Navigate to the respective directory for specific setup and usage instructions.

## Requirements

Each case study has its own specific requirements. Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed information about dependencies and setup.
